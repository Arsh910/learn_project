Linting  (tools to check code formatting)
    install flake8 package
    config flake8 (place in app dir)
    run it through docker compose 

Testing 
    Django test suite 


requirements.dev.txt is only for development dependencies

Github actions (for automation , for linting , for unit testing)
    create a config file 
    add steps for linting and testing
    docker hub auth 


Mocking (change behaviour of dependencies)
    example : prevent sending email every time tests run.


Database Setup
    PostgresSQL
    update the compose file 
        add volumes, db service
        add environment variables 

Django setup with DB 
    install Psycopg2 package 
        options:
            .psycopg2-binary
            .psycopg2 (good to use)            

    for psycopg2 we need
        c compiler
        python3-dev
        libpq-dev
    
    equivalent packages for alpine 
        postgressql-client
        only need to install the package (not to run)
            build-base
            postgressql-dev
            musl-dev
        so we clean them afterwards
